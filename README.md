Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
-Software engineering is the discipline of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software systems
- It helps ensure that technology serves both businesses and users in the best possible way.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
-1940s-1950s: The Birth of Programming
Early computers were programmed using machine code and assembly language, laying the foundation for software development.
1960s-1970s: Structured Programming & Methodologies
Introduction of structured programming, formal methodologies, and the first high-level languages (e.g., FORTRAN, COBOL).
1990s-Present: Agile & Modern Development Practices
Emergence of agile methodologies, continuous integration, version control, and modern IDEs, revolutionizing the development process for faster, iterative delivery.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
-Planning- Define the overall goals, scope, resources, budget, and timeline for the project.
-Requirements Analysis- Gather and document all the requirements for the software from the stakeholders, including users, business teams, and developers.
-Design- Create a blueprint for how the software will be structured and how it will meet the defined requirements.
-Coding- Convert the design into executable software by writing the actual code
-Testing- Ensure the software is functioning as expected and identify any bugs or issues
-Deployment-Release the software to the production environment where it will be used by the end-users.
-Maintenance- Ensure the software continues to function as expected after deployment, with regular updates and fixes as needed.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
	
In Approach	Waterfall	Agile is Linear and sequential	Iterative and incremental while agile is Iterative and incremental
When it comes to flexibility in waterfall the Flexibility is	Rigid,while in agile changes are difficult	Highly flexible, adapts to changes
When it comes to Client Involvement watefall is Minimal, while in agile it mostly at start and end	Continuous, throughout the project

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS
-The primary role of a software developer is to design, code, test, and maintain software applications or systems.
Quality Assurance
-ensures the software meets quality standards and is free of defects before release.
Project Manager
-oversees the entire software development lifecycle, ensuring the project is delivered on time, within budget, and meets stakeholder expectations.
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDES
-Code editing amd error highlighting- provide advanced code editors with syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and error detection, making it easier to write and debug code.
-Cross-Platform Support-Many IDEs support multiple programming languages and platforms, making them versatile for diverse projects.
examples-VS CODE,Eclipse
VCS
Collaboration-enables multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes.
Backup and Recovery-acts as a backup system, ensuring code is not lost due to accidental deletions or hardware failures.
EXAMPLES-GIT

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-Dealing with Tight Deadlines-Focus on delivering the most important features first.
-Keeping Up with Rapid Technological Advancements-Dedicate time to learning and experimenting with new technologies, whether through online courses, conferences, blogs, or coding communities.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
-Unit testing-testing indidvidual components and functions of the software to ensure each works correctly in isolation.
-Intergration testing- focuses on testing the interactions between different modules or components of the software to ensure they work together as expected.
-System testing- ensures that the software meets the specified requirements and performs well in the intended environment.
-Acceptance testing- the final phase of testing before the software is released to the customer or end-user.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
- It is the practice of crafting inputs that guide AI models to produce more accurate, relevant, and useful outputs
 -The better your prompt, the better the AIâ€™s response!
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Write a story.
Write a short horror story in the style of Edgar Allan Poe, with a setting in a spooky, abandoned mansion during a storm
